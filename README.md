✨ Why settle for a boring résumé when you can **_glow up_** your dev journey?  
This is my personalized, React-powered portfolio — showing off not just what I’ve built, but how I build it. Smooth navigation, vibrant vibes, and a clean UI built with Vite + Tailwind + a dash of personality.

## 📝 Description
Say goodbye to cookie-cutter dev sites 👋 — My portfolio brings my work and story to life in a way that reflects who I am.  
It opens with a vibrant **About Me** section, then flows through Projects, Resume, and Contact via a smooth, responsive navbar. Every section is tailored, minimal, and mobile-ready — no unnecessary fluff, just clean code and sharp content. Built with **React**, styled in **Tailwind CSS**, and deployed with 💯 intent.
